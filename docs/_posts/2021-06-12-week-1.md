## PyQt5 GUI

This is the first week of coding period, so I started with designing UI for the web-templates. I began by making a simple PyQt5 GUI for a pick-and-place exercise.

[PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) is a comprehensive set of Python bindings for Qt v5. It is implemented as more than 35 extension modules and enables Python to be used as an alternative application development language to C++ on all supported platforms including iOS and Android.

Since the pick and place exercise necessitates heavy use of Gazebo and Rviz, I positioned their displays side by side so that users would not experience difficulty scrolling or changing tabs. The basic design of a GUI is seen in the figure below.

Since Robotics Academy has shifted to web-templates, we will no longer be working on PyQt5 GUIs and will instead focus on improving the web-templates of current exercises.

## Adding cards for pick and place exercise

To include a new exercise, one needs to add the folder with the exercise contents in exercises/static/exercises following the file name conventions. Then, create the entry in db.sqlite3. A simple way to do this is by using the Django admin page:

1. Run python3.8 manage.py runserver.
2. Access http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ on a browser and log in with "user" and "pass".
3. Click on "add exercise" and fill the fields: exercise id (folder name), name (name to display), state, language and description (description to display). Save and exit.
4. Commit db.sqlite3 changes.

## User Interface for pick and place exercise

After creating a card for pick and place, I started working on User Interface of the exercise. As already mentioned, this exercise relies heavily on Rviz and Gazebo and does not require use of any additional widgets.
