<p>Mimic joint plugin is a simple (Model) plugin for Gazebo in order to add to Gazebo the mimic joint functionality that exists in URDF (ROS). Last week, the simulation wasn‚Äôt operational because of an error related to this plugin. The error shown in the terminal was:</p>

<p>As clear from the error message, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libroboticsgroup_gazebo_mimic_joint_plugin</code> was missing but when I checked the IndustrialRobots repository, I found out that the plugin was already there. In addition, the simulation ran well on my system. After inspecting the env variables, I decided to explicitly define plugin path. So I updated the ‚ÄòGAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH` and guess what, grippers were working now.</p>

<p>After resolving the issue with the plugins, I took the code from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MyAlgorithm.py</code> and modified it according to new HAL APIs. The final video simulation of pick &amp; place of blue sphere is shown below:</p>

<p>The issue we were facing was ‚ÄúAddress already in use,‚Äù which means the server was either configured twice or there was a conflict while connecting the ws client and server because they both utilise the same port. I made some changes to exercise.py (removing the unnecessary routines related to GUI.py) and wolllaahh!!, the exercise was connected.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start working on getting the Rviz in our exercise.</li>
  <li>Debug the simulation of pick and place exercise</li>
  <li>Create the rest of HAL APIs</li>
  <li>Finalize the exercise and push the changes to the master branch before first evaluation</li>
</ul>

<p>We decided to utilise Rviz instead of a widget after connecting the exercise to the server. Thanks to Siddharth, who had previously integrated Rviz into his project, working on Rviz was a lot easier for me. Not to mention, the diffs were created systematically to emphasise the essential adjustments, ensuring that the task went off without a hitch. The only thing I needed to do was resize the Rviz display to fit in the VNC window. This was readily accomplished by altering the rviz configuration files. One of the other minor errors I encountered was that the objects in the rviz weren‚Äôt spawning properly. After some investigation, I discovered that the time between the two threads was insufficient, which explains the issue with spawning the objects. A different thread with a longer elapsed period did an excellent job of spawning.</p>
