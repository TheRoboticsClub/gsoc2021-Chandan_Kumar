<p>There were several issues that we were facing in the migration of Machine Vision Exercise which are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not only the position of the object was registered wrong but the shape detected by object_shape_filter was wrong. And we had no idea of the reason behind this behaviour.</li>
  <li>Yijia also mentioned that since this exercise uses a vaccum gripper and not a qrt_gripper, he faced many difficulties while simulating the picking mechanism last year because The object slips out from the vaccum gripper making it very difficult to complete the task.</li>
</ul>

<p>Considering all these points, we decided to move on to mobile manipulation exercise which uses rqt_gripper. We planned to first finish Mobile manipulation exercise and then move on to machine vision.</p>

<h2 id="migration-to-radi-3-or-migration-of-rest-of-the-exercises">Migration to RADI-3 or Migration of rest of the exercises</h2>

<p>Instead of moving the rest of the exercises to RADI-2 (Melodic + Python2), Jose Maria proposed that we migrate the existing pick and place exercises to RADI-3 (Noetic + Python3). Rviz, like Gzclient and console for most RADI-3 exercises, can be used as an additional tool in other RADI-3 exercises. This would also act as a feature to the new RADI and future debugging will be a lot easier as one will not have to make the changes in RADI-3 as well as RADI-2(if Rviz is integrated in RADI-2). After considering all of this, my mentors and I agreed, and we met to re-create our weekly goals.</p>

<p>However, after pulling the RADI-3 docker image and making some adjustments, I discovered that most of the industrial rtobot packages were reporting problems. The reason for this was that these packages were produced with Melodic, and I needed to make some changes to run them on Noetic. But the problem with that I have Melodic installed in my PC on Ubuntu 18.04. So, in order to debug, Iâ€™ll have to first instal Ubuntu 20.02, then Noetic, which is not only a time-consuming job, but also one that I canâ€™t just abandon to my ongoing Melodic projects.</p>

<p>So, after talking with my mentor about it, we decided to keep moving forward with the exercise conversion to web-templates. We may then go on to the RADI-3 migration of exercises after the exercises have been transferred.</p>

<h2 id="migration-of-mobile-manipulation-exercise">Migration of Mobile Manipulation Exercise</h2>

<p>So, after a lengthy time of deliberation, I returned to coding and began working on the mobile migration exercises migration. I began by writing the simulationâ€™s code. Its navigation functioned properly, but it was unable to pickup the objects. I needed to fine-tune WIDTH since the items were slipping out of the grippers. Fortunately, Yijia had the solutionÂ to this exercise, which he had prepared the previous year. When I tested hisÂ code, it worked flawlessly.</p>

<p>After that, I made a card for the Mobile Manipulation exercise and a prototype for the new exercises. The first testing revealed a large number of problems linked to missing packages (mainly navigation packages). Even after installing those packages, there were still two problems that I couldnâ€™t fix.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Cannot locate node of type [scan_unifier_node] in package [cob_scan_unifier]. Make sure file exists in package path and permission is set to executable (chmod +x)

Failed to load plugin libgazebo_ros_moveit_planning_scene.so: libgazebo_ros_moveit_planning_scene.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first problem indicates that the file requires executable permissions, however this was not resolved even after executing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod +x</code> command. 
According to the second error, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libgazebo ros moveit planning scene</code> plugin was missing. I looked for it on the internet but couldnâ€™t find anything. Whatâ€™s strange is that thereâ€™s no such issue when I run it locally, and this package doesnâ€™t even exist on my machine.</p>
